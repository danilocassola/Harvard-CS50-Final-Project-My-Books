# My Books
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/RuEsGwD4YIs>
#### Description:
This is the Final Project CS50.

My Books is a web application that you can manager your books, you can add or delete a book in your booklist, you can know which books you lent and which book is in your library, also who borrowed and when you lent it.

You have to register to use it, which user can have your booklist, it's possible to chance your password.

My Books is a simple application, but very useful.

It's very ease to forget which or for who you lent your book, I've lost a few books because I don't remember for who I lent it.

I hope you enjoy it.

I used CS50 IDE from Harvard to develop my web application.

I developed it using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, SQLite and Bootstrap.

Inside the folder templates there are some html files, all the information that repeat in all pages, like <html>, <head>, <meta>, <body> and so far, you can put in just one html, in my project this file is layout.html. The others html files use this information to complete the code.

Inside the folder static, there is my styles.css, the image I used to background and my favicon.

In applycation.py there are the codes to run the application, there is a line of code that import another file with codes, the file is helpers.py.

I used that structure and some codes from the CS50 problem set 9 Finance.

There is a file named mybooks.db, it's a SQLITE database with the books you added and registered users.



About the technologies:

Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) or such features.

Python is a programming language.

HTML - HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets is a mechanism for adding style to a web document

SQLite is a C language library that implements an embedded SQL database.

Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.

In CS50 you learn about this technologies, so you can develop your Final Project.



Thank you.
